# Book Search Engine
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)

## Description

This is a program that allows a user to sign up and log in, searches for books using GoogleBooks, and can save books to a User's profile. Unfortunately, it's got a couple of issues I hope to fix later, namely, the remove book function doesn't work.

Here's a link to the deployed site: https://book-search-dfm-917cd4c03351.herokuapp.com/

Here's a screenshot:

Clicking the buttons on the front end mostly results in the thing the button says will happen, except for the aforementioned "remove book" bug.
